# Tutorial Intro

Let's discover **GCOEJ EXAMP PREP in less than 5 minutes**.

## Getting Started



### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 16.14 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

## Generate a new site
Clone this site by using below command.

The folder named gcoejexamprep will automatically be added to your project after you run the command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shubhamAW/gcoejexamprep/
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run this site locally.
```bash
 npm install
```


## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
cd gcoejexamprep
npm  start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with.

The `npm start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.
