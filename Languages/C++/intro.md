# introduction

**C++** is a middle-level programming language developed by **Bjarne Stroustrup** starting in 1979 at Bell Labs. C++ runs on a variety of platforms, such as Windows, Mac OS, and the various versions of UNIX. This C++ tutorial adopts a simple and practical approach to describe the concepts of C++ for beginners to advanded software engineers.

## Why to Learn C++

* C++ is very close to hardware, so you get a chance to work at a low level which gives you lot of control in terms of memory management.
* C++ programming gives you a clear understanding about Object Oriented Programming. You will understand low level implementation of polymorphism when you will implement virtual tables and virtual table pointers, or dynamic **type identification**.
* C++ is one of the every green programming languages and loved by millions of software developers.
* C++ is the most widely used programming languages in application and system programming
* C++ really teaches you the difference between compiler, linker and loader, different data types, storage classes, variable types their scopes etc.

## Hello World Using C++

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// main() is where program execution begins.
int main() {
   cout << "Hello World"; // prints Hello World
   return 0;
}
```

## Applications of C++ Programming

1. Application Software Development - C++ programming has been used in developing almost all the major Operating Systems like Windows, Mac OSX and Linux.
2. Programming Languages Development - C++ has been used extensively in developing new programming languages like C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, UNIXâ€™s C Shell, PHP and Python, and Verilog etc.
3. Computation Programming - C++ is the best friends of scientists because of fast speed and computational efficiencies.
4. Embedded System - C++ is being heavily used in developing Medical and Engineering Applications like softwares for MRI machines, high-end CAD/CAM systems etc. 

## Prerequisites

Before you start practicing with various types of examples given in this C++ tutorial,we are making an assumption that you are already aware of the basics of computer program and computer programming language.
