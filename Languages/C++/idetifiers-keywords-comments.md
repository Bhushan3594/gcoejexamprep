# Identifiers keywords and comments

## c++ identifiers

A C++ identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, class, module, or any other user-defined item. An identifier starts with a letter A to Z or a to z or an underscore (_) followed by zero or more letters, underscores, and digits (0 to 9).

:::danger
C++ does not allow punctuation characters such as @, $, and % within identifiers. C++ is a case-sensitive programming language. Thus, **hello** and **Hello** are two different identifiers in C++.

Here are some examples of acceptable identifiers âˆ’

myname50   _temp   j     a23b9      retVal
